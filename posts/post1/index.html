                <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science which simulates intelligent behaviour in computers. It helps in automating daily tasks and taking well-calculated decisions in computers. Such tasks involve problem-solving, motion in robots, perception, planning etc. AI can be further divided into 3 subgroups.</p>
                <h2>Artificial Narrow Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Any kind of AI that humans have made to date falls under this category. These are able to perform certain specific tasks at humans level precision but that’s it. Nothing more than that.</p>
                <h2>Artificial General Intelligence</h2>
                <p>These are advanced forms of AI which can take human-level decisions and can understand new information like a human. Thus cutting down the time required in training these machines. They can understand and manipulate interdisciplinary data.</p>
                <h2>Artificial Super Intelligence</h2>
                <p>Very far fetched version of AI, the pinnacle of AI research. The most evolved form of artificial intelligence which can perform better than humans in every domain.</p>
                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses complex mathematical algorithms to solve problems related to data and make intelligent decisions based on the data it has learned from. The decision making ability is not explicitly programmed by the programmer but instead are learned by the computer. In short, it takes data and parameters as inputs and then defines a mathematical model which gives the best results based on the input.</p>
                <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
                <p>Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which uses layers of neural networks to simulate human decision making. The use of neural networks in deep learning helps in taking decisions based on previous trends and they don’t plateau like machine learning algorithms. They can better label, categorize data and find patterns in data. Which can be further used in solving problems.</p>
                <h2>Data Science </h2>
                <p>Data Science coincides to some extent with machine learning but also includes statistics and data visualization. In Data Science we use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to make sense of the huge amount of data that is being collected and data visualization to visualize the data. The insights from the data are used by data analysts to understand the trends and predict viable solutions from a business perspective.</p>
